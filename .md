# 🎨 Poster Scoring System  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Poster Scoring System** is a React-based web application designed to allow judges to score posters securely. It integrates Firebase Firestore for storing scores, supports PIN-based authentication, and generates QR codes for accessing individual poster scoring pages.

## 🚀 Features  
- **PIN-Based Authentication**: Judges enter a PIN to verify their identity.  
- **Score Submission**: Judges can submit or update scores for assigned posters.  
- **QR Code Generation**: Generates QR codes for quick access to poster scoring pages.  
- **Firebase Firestore Integration**: Stores scores and judge assignments in Firestore.  
- **Excel Upload Support**: Poster and judge data can be uploaded from Excel files.

- Ensure the Excel file is formatted correctly with column headers like `Poster #`, `Title`, `Abstract`, `Judge 1`, etc.  

## 📡 Generating QR Codes  
Run the QR code generation script to create QR codes linking to poster scoring pages:  
```bash
node generateQRcode.js
```
QR codes will be saved in the `qrcodes/` directory.

## 📜 Technologies Used  
- **React.js**  
- **Firebase Firestore**
